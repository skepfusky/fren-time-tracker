# Fren Time Tracker

Do you have friends that live in a different timezone? Are you on a place
where most of your friends are living on the other side of the planet? There's
a solution for that!

You can now track your friends' timezone to see if they're either sleeping or
probably waking up, you can know what time they're currently on.

Made in Nextron with TypeScript and TailwindCSS.

## Why?

I couldn't find any app that can help me track of various timezones, some of
them I could find are locked behind a paywall, so I made this :3
