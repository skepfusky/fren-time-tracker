# Fren Time Tracker

Do you have friends that live in a different timezone? Are you on a place
where most of your friends are living on the other side of the planet? There's
a solution for that!

You can now track your friends' timezone to see if they're either sleeping or
probably waking up, you can know what time they're currently on.

Made in Vue 3 with TypeScript + Vite + Electron with TypeScript.
